## 1: Which partner should we focus on with lower target achievement in test positivity for the year?

When we take a look at prime partners’ `HTS_TST_POS` reported versus their targets for the current year (`FY2061`), we see the following:

```{r}
# Filter to the current year (2061)
filtered_data_q1 <- data %>%
  filter(fiscal_year == 2061, indicator == "HTS_TST_POS")

# Find reported HTS_TST_POS versus targets
summary_table_q1 <- filtered_data_q1 %>%
  group_by(prime_partner_name) %>%
  summarise(
    PSNUs = paste(unique(psnu), collapse = ", "),
    Targets = sum(targets, na.rm = TRUE),
    Cumulative = sum(cumulative, na.rm = TRUE),
    Achievement = if_else(
      Targets > 0,
      round(Cumulative / Targets * 100, 0),
      NA_real_
    )
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(Achievement)) %>%
  mutate(Achievement = ifelse(is.na(Achievement), "No targets", paste0(Achievement, "%")))
```

**`FY2061` (through `Q3`) Achievement of `HTS_TST_POS` Targets by Prime Partner**

```{r echo=FALSE}
print(summary_table_q1)
```

This is through `Q3` of the year, as there is no `Q4` data available. With a cursory glance, we can see that:

- Three of the partners (`Jumbo Shrimp` and `Pelicans`(*both operating in `Winston-Salem`*) and `SeaWolves`) did not have targets in the data. 
- Eight of 12 (`75%`) of our prime partners with targets achieved 100% or more of their targets for `HTS_TST_POS`.
- Of the remaining four partners who did not meet their targets, two are >95%, indicating they are very close to their targets. 

The two partners with lower rates are `Dash`(`30%`) and `Cardinals`(`52%`). To view this in context, we can also explore the previous year's data. The previous year (`FY2060`), `Cardinals` had the lowest achievement at `19%`(*excluding `Red Sox` who did not report any `HTS_TST_POS` results*). This year, `FY2061`, `Dash` has the lowest achievement of target at `30%`, which is down from `56%` in `FY2060`.

```{r}
# Do the same for 2060 data
filtered_data_2060 <- data %>%
  filter(fiscal_year == 2060, indicator == "HTS_TST_POS")

summary_table_2060 <- filtered_data_2060 %>%
  group_by(prime_partner_name) %>%
  summarise(
    PSNUs = paste(unique(psnu), collapse = ", "),
    Targets = sum(targets, na.rm = TRUE),
    Cumulative = sum(cumulative, na.rm = TRUE),
    Achievement = if_else(
      Targets > 0,
      round(Cumulative / Targets * 100, 0),
      NA_real_
    )
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(Achievement)) %>%
  mutate(Achievement = ifelse(is.na(Achievement), "No targets", paste0(Achievement, "%")))
```
**`FY2060` Achievement of `HTS_TST_POS` Targets by Prime Partner**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(summary_table_2060)
```

To understand where the `Dash`'s issues may be, we can also take a look at which PSNUs they are operating in. `Dash` appears to be closer to its targets in the `Salt Lake` PSNU than the `Sugar Land` PSNU:

```{r}
# Filter to Dash only and group by PSNU
summary_table_q1_DASH_PSNU <- data %>%
  filter(
    fiscal_year == 2061,
    indicator == "HTS_TST_POS",
    prime_partner_name == "Dash"
  ) %>%
  group_by(psnu) %>%
  summarise(
    Targets = sum(targets, na.rm = TRUE),
    Cumulative = sum(cumulative, na.rm = TRUE),
    Achievement = if_else(
      Targets > 0,
      round(Cumulative / Targets * 100, 0),
      NA_real_
    )
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(Achievement)) %>%
  mutate(Achievement = paste0(Achievement, "%"))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
print(summary_table_q1_DASH_PSNU)
```

Zooming out, we also will want to consider both the percentage of target achievement and the scale of the operation. 

- For example, if Partner A has a target of 20 and reports 10, they have a 50% achievement rate. While this seems significant, the overall impact is relatively small due to the low target number.
- In contrast, Partner B has a target of 10,000 and reports 6,000, resulting in a 60% achievement rate. Although this rate is higher than Partner A's, the absolute gap in performance is much larger. The magnitude of the shortfall for Partner B is much more substantial.

We can normalize performance based on the size of the operation to ensure that we direct resources effectively. By min-max scaling our targets and cumulative scores across partners, I created a simple composite score equation:

\[
\text{Partner Composite Score} = (\text{Normalized Target} + \text{Normalized Cumulative}) \times (1 - \text{Achievement Ratio})
\]

This formula combines the scaled values of targets and cumulative results with the inverse of the achievement ratio, where higher composite scores (indicating worse performance) are driven by high normalized targets and cumulative results paired with a low achievement ratio. This method allows us to identify partners with significant operational scope who are underperforming, helping prioritize interventions and allocate resources efficiently.

```{r}
# Grab min and maxes for targets and cumulative HTS_TST_POS
min_targets <- min(summary_table_q1$Targets[summary_table_q1$Targets > 0], na.rm = TRUE)
max_targets <- max(summary_table_q1$Targets[summary_table_q1$Targets > 0], na.rm = TRUE)
min_cumulative <- min(summary_table_q1$Cumulative[summary_table_q1$Cumulative > 0], na.rm = TRUE)
max_cumulative <- max(summary_table_q1$Cumulative[summary_table_q1$Cumulative > 0], na.rm = TRUE)

# Normalization function
normalize <- function(value, min_value, max_value) {
  (value - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)
}

# Normalize the table and calculate the score
normalized_summary_table_q1 <- summary_table_q1 %>%
  mutate(
    Normalized_Targets = normalize(Targets, min_targets, max_targets),
    Normalized_Cumulative = normalize(Cumulative, min_cumulative, max_cumulative),
    Achievement_Ratio = if_else(Targets > 0,
      Cumulative / Targets,
      NA_real_
    ),
    Achievement_Ratio = if_else(is.na(Achievement_Ratio), 1, Achievement_Ratio),
    Score = (Normalized_Targets + Normalized_Cumulative) * (1 - Achievement_Ratio)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(Score))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(normalized_summary_table_q1)
```

In this instance, it still looks like we should prioritize **`Dash`** given `FY2061` data, as they have the highest composite score. This indicates that although their normalized targets and cumulative results are relatively high, their achievement ratio is low, suggesting room for improvement.

#### **<span style="color:#2057a7"> Question: Is this normalization method commonly used, and should I have applied it in this instance? It felt like just going off of percentage was not taking into account scale. Would love to know more here.</span>**


## 2. What share of total and positive tests are from index testing in the latest quarter?

To answer this question, we can look at modality disaggregation for `HTS_TST` and `HTS_TST_POS`.

```{r}
# Pivot the table into longer format
data_long <- data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("qtr"),
    names_to = "quarter", # New column for the quarter
    values_to = "value" # New column for the values
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(value)) %>%
  mutate(
    quarter = gsub("qtr", "", quarter) # Remove "qtr" from quarter names (now in integer format)
  )

# Group by indicator and find instances of HTS_TST and HTS_TST_POS that are from the index modality
summary_table_q2 <- data_long %>%
  filter(
    fiscal_year == 2061,
    indicator %in% c("HTS_TST", "HTS_TST_POS"),
    quarter == 3
  ) %>% # Filter to most recent quarter (2061 Q3)
  group_by(indicator) %>%
  summarise(
    All = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE), # Sum for all modalities (denominator)
    Index_Only = sum(if_else(modality == "Index", value, 0), na.rm = TRUE), # Sum for only 'Index' modality (numerator)
    Percentage_From_Index = paste0(round((Index_Only / All) * 100, 2), "%")
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
```

**`FY2061 Q3` `HTS_TST` & `HTS_TST_POS` Values by Index Modality**

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary_table_q2
```
We see that in the latest quarter (`FY2061 Q3`), **`1.92%`** of `HTS_TST` are from Index testing and **`14.86%`** of `HTS_TST_POS` are from Index testing.

#### **<span style="color:#2057a7"> Question: What about Active Index and IndexMod? Should I have included those as 'Index' modalities?</span>**

## 3. Which sub-national units (SNUs) have seen a decline in testing over the last few quarters but an increase in positivity?

We can take a look at testing and positive testing trends over the most recent few quarters.
```{r}
# Grab two years of recent data to analyze trends
relevant_quarters <- c("2059Q3", "2059Q4", "2060Q1", "2060Q2", "2060Q3", "2060Q4", "2061Q1", "2061Q2", "2061Q3")

filtered_data <- data_long %>%
  filter(paste(fiscal_year, quarter, sep = "Q") %in% relevant_quarters)

# Pivot the data to have separate columns for HTS_TST and HTS_TST_POS
summary_data_q3 <- filtered_data %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = indicator, values_from = value, values_fill = list(value = 0)) %>%
  group_by(snu1, fiscal_year, quarter) %>%
  summarise(
    Total_Testing = sum(HTS_TST, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_Positive = sum(HTS_TST_POS, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_Positivity_Ratio = (sum(HTS_TST_POS, na.rm = TRUE) / sum(HTS_TST, na.rm = TRUE)),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    Year_Quarter = paste(fiscal_year, quarter, sep = "_Q")
  ) %>%
  select(snu1, Year_Quarter, Total_Testing, Total_Positive, Total_Positivity_Ratio)

summary_data_q3_display <- summary_data_q3 %>%
  mutate(
    Total_Positivity_Ratio = scales::percent(round(Total_Positivity_Ratio, 4))
  )
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
print(summary_data_q3)
```
Visualizing the trends in each SNU:
```{r}
library(scales)
create_plot <- function(snu_name, value_col, secondary_col, y_label, sec_y_label, color_map, is_percentage = FALSE) {
  data_snu <- summary_data_q3 %>% filter(snu1 == snu_name)

  # Calculate scaling factor for the secondary axis
  max_testing <- max(data_snu$Total_Testing, na.rm = TRUE)
  max_value <- max(data_snu[[secondary_col]], na.rm = TRUE)
  scaling_factor <- max_testing / max_value

  # Create a combined label with year and quarter
  data_snu <- data_snu %>%
    mutate(Year = sub("_(.*)", "", Year_Quarter),
           Quarter = sub("(.*)_", "", Year_Quarter),
           Combined_Label = paste0(Year, "\n", Quarter)) %>%  # Year on second line
    arrange(factor(Quarter, levels = c("Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4")),
            factor(Year, levels = c("2059", "2060", "2061")))

  ggplot(data_snu, aes(x = Combined_Label)) +
    geom_line(aes(y = Total_Testing, color = '# Tests'), linewidth = 1, group = 1) +
    geom_line(aes(y = get(secondary_col) * scaling_factor, color = sec_y_label),
              linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 1, group = 1) +
    scale_y_continuous(
      name = y_label,
      labels = number_format(),
      sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . / scaling_factor,
                          name = sec_y_label,
                          labels = if (is_percentage) percent_format() else number_format())
    ) +
    labs(title = snu_name, x = "", color = "Legend") +
    theme_minimal() +
    scale_color_manual(values = color_map) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +  # Adjust x-axis text for better visibility
    si_style()
}


# Plot by % of Tests that are Positive
create_plot_pr <- function(snu_name) {
  create_plot(
    snu_name, "Total_Testing", "Total_Positivity_Ratio",
    "# Tests", "% Positive", c("# Tests" = denim, "% Positive" = old_rose), TRUE
  )
}

# Plot by Total Number of Positive Tests
create_plot_num <- function(snu_name) {
  create_plot(
    snu_name, "Total_Testing", "Total_Positive",
    "# Tests", "# Positive", c("# Tests" = denim, "# Positive" = old_rose)
  )
}

summary_data_q3$Year_Quarter <- factor(
  summary_data_q3$Year_Quarter,
  levels = c("2059_Q3", "2059_Q4", "2060_Q1", "2060_Q2", "2060_Q3", "2060_Q4", "2061_Q1", "2061_Q2", "2061_Q3")
)

snu_names <- unique(summary_data_q3$snu1)
```

***Please note, the following charts have dual axes and varying scales.***

**By Positivity Rate**
```{r}
# Generate plots for each SNU using the percentage plot function
plots_pr <- lapply(snu_names, create_plot_pr)

# Combine all plots into a single layout
combined_plot_pr <- wrap_plots(plots_pr, ncol = 2) + plot_layout(guides = "collect") & theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=14, fig.height=8}
print(combined_plot_pr)
```

**By Total # Positive Tests**

```{r}
# Generate plots for each SNU using the num plot function
plots_num <- lapply(snu_names, create_plot_num)

# Combine all plots into a single layout
combined_plot_num <- wrap_plots(plots_num, ncol = 2) + plot_layout(guides = "collect") & theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=14, fig.height=8}
print(combined_plot_num)
```

In the time period studied, I do not see any SNU where the number of positive tests or positivity ratio has increased and the total number of tests has decreased.

- *Midwest*: Testing rose sharply and then fell recently. Positivity rate fell.

- *Northwest*: Testing rose sharply and then fell recently. Positivity rate fell.

- *Pacific Coast*: Testing rose. Positivity rate fell.

- *South Atlantic*: Testing rose. Positivity rate had a lot of variation.

We can also try to smooth over any quarter spikes or outliers by calculating moving averages.
```{r}
# Calculate 3-quarter moving averages for each SNU
summary_data_q3 <- summary_data_q3 %>%
  group_by(snu1) %>%
  arrange(Year_Quarter) %>%
  mutate(
    Testing_MA = rollmean(Total_Testing, k = 3, fill = NA, align = "right"), # 3-quarter moving average for testing
    Positivity_MA = rollmean(Total_Positivity_Ratio, k = 3, fill = NA, align = "right") # 3-quarter moving average for positivity ratio
  ) %>%
  select(snu1, Year_Quarter, Testing_MA, Positivity_MA, Total_Testing, Total_Positivity_Ratio) %>%
  ungroup()

print(summary_data_q3)

# Calculate trends in moving averages
decline_in_testing_increase_in_positivity_ma <- summary_data_q3 %>%
  group_by(snu1) %>%
  arrange(Year_Quarter) %>%
  summarise(
    testing_trend_ma = last(Testing_MA, na.rm = TRUE) - first(Testing_MA, na.rm = TRUE), # Trend in testing moving average
    positivity_trend_ma = last(Positivity_MA, na.rm = TRUE) - first(Positivity_MA, na.rm = TRUE) # Trend in positivity moving average
  ) %>%
  filter(testing_trend_ma < 0 & positivity_trend_ma > 0)
```

**Moving Averages**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(decline_in_testing_increase_in_positivity_ma)
```
There are no SNUs with a negative trend in testing and positive trend in positivity when looking at moving averages.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
create_plot_q3_ma <- function(snu_name) {
  data_snu <- summary_data_q3 %>%
    filter(snu1 == snu_name) %>%
    filter(!is.na(Total_Testing) & !is.na(Testing_MA) & !is.na(Positivity_MA))
  
  data_snu <- data_snu %>%
    mutate(Year = sub("_(.*)", "", Year_Quarter),
           Quarter = sub("(.*)_", "", Year_Quarter),
           Combined_Label = paste0(Year, "\n", Quarter)) %>%  # Year on second line
    arrange(factor(Quarter, levels = c("Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4")),
            factor(Year, levels = c("2059", "2060", "2061")))

  # Calculate scaling factor for the secondary axis
  max_testing <- max(data_snu$Total_Testing, na.rm = TRUE)
  max_positivity <- max(data_snu$Positivity_MA, na.rm = TRUE)
  scaling_factor <- max_testing / max_positivity

  ggplot(data_snu, aes(x = Combined_Label)) +
    geom_line(aes(y = Testing_MA, color = "Testing MA"), linewidth = 1, group = 1) +
    geom_line(aes(y = Positivity_MA * scaling_factor, color = "Positivity MA"), linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 1, group = 1) +
    scale_y_continuous(name = "# Tests",
                       labels = number_format(), 
                       sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . / scaling_factor, 
                                           name = "% Positive", 
                                           labels = scales::percent_format())) +
    labs(
      title = snu_name,

```{r}

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=14, fig.height=8}
print(combined_plot_ma)
```

We still do not see any SNUs where there is a decline in testing and an increase in positivity.

## 4. What share of newly initiated patients onto treatment have a CD4 count of less than 200?

```{r}
# In the data, only 2061 has values for CD4
data_2061 <- data_long %>%
  filter(fiscal_year == 2061)

# Total number of newly initiated patients (TX_NEW) with CD4 count < 200
cumulative_txnew_lessthan200cd4 <- data_2061 %>%
  filter(indicator == "TX_NEW", otherdisaggregate == "<200 CD4") %>%
  summarise(Total_Cumulative = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(Total_Cumulative)

# Total number of newly initiated patients (TX_NEW) with CD4 count >= 200
cumulative_txnew_greaterthan200cd4 <- data_2061 %>%
  filter(indicator == "TX_NEW", otherdisaggregate == ">=200 CD4") %>%
  summarise(Total_Cumulative = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(Total_Cumulative)

# Total number of newly initiated patients (TX_NEW)
total_tx_new <- data_2061 %>%
  filter(indicator == "TX_NEW") %>%
  summarise(Total_New = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(Total_New)

# Comparison of CD4 counts
cumulative_txnew_cd4_comparison <- data_2061 %>%
  filter(indicator == "TX_NEW", otherdisaggregate %in% c("<200 CD4", ">=200 CD4")) %>%
  group_by(fiscal_year, otherdisaggregate) %>%
  summarise(
    Total_CD4_Count = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = otherdisaggregate, values_from = Total_CD4_Count, values_fill = list(Total_CD4_Count = 0)) %>%
  mutate(
    Total_Treatment_with_CD4_disagg = `<200 CD4` + `>=200 CD4`,
    Percentage_Less_Than_200_CD4 = round((`<200 CD4` / Total_Treatment_with_CD4_disagg) * 100, 2),
    Percentage_Greater_Than_Equal_200_CD4 = round((`>=200 CD4` / Total_Treatment_with_CD4_disagg) * 100, 2)
  )

# Combine the comparison and total
cumulative_txnew_cd4_comparison <- cumulative_txnew_cd4_comparison %>%
  mutate(Total_TX_New = total_tx_new)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Display the results
print(cumulative_txnew_cd4_comparison)
```

```{r}
total_below_200 <- cumulative_txnew_cd4_comparison$`<200 CD4`
below_200_percentage <- paste0(cumulative_txnew_cd4_comparison$Percentage_Less_Than_200_CD4, "%")

total_percentage_both_categories <- paste0(
  round(((cumulative_txnew_lessthan200cd4 + cumulative_txnew_greaterthan200cd4) / total_tx_new) * 100, 2),
  "%"
)
```
It appears that ``r total_below_200`` newly initiated patients had a CD4 <200 in `FY2061`. This is ``r below_200_percentage`` of newly initiated patients that have a reported CD4 in the data.

Importantly, only ``r total_percentage_both_categories`` have a CD4 value in 2061 (the only year with CD4 disaggregated). As a note, the only year that reports this data is `FY2061`. We can look at the trends by quarter within the year as well.

```{r}
# Calculate cumulative CD4 counts for newly initiated patients in 2061
cumulative_txnew_cd4_comparison <- data_2061 %>%
  filter(indicator == "TX_NEW", otherdisaggregate %in% c("<200 CD4", ">=200 CD4")) %>%
  group_by(fiscal_year, quarter, otherdisaggregate) %>%
  summarise(
    Total_CD4_Count = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pivot_wider( # Reshape data to wide format with separate columns for each CD4 category
    names_from = otherdisaggregate,
    values_from = Total_CD4_Count,
    values_fill = list(Total_CD4_Count = 0)
  ) %>%
  mutate( # Calculate percentage of patients in each CD4 category
    Percentage_Less_Than_200_CD4 = paste0(
      round((`<200 CD4` / (`<200 CD4` + `>=200 CD4`)) * 100, 2), "%"
    ),
    Percentage_Greater_Than_Equal_200_CD4 = paste0(
      round((`>=200 CD4` / (`<200 CD4` + `>=200 CD4`)) * 100, 2), "%"
    )
  )
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(cumulative_txnew_cd4_comparison)
```
#### **<span style="color:#2057a7">Question: I am not sure I did this all right. Should I be comparing the <200 and >=200 CD4 disaggregates like this? Why do only so few have this disagg?</span>**

## 5. Which age bands have had two or more quarters with declining net new on treatment?

Two or more total quarters with declining net new on treatment:
```{r}
# Calculate net new patient counts and identify declining trends by age
net_new_declining <- data_long %>%
  mutate(Year_Quarter = paste(fiscal_year, quarter, sep = "_Q")) %>%
  filter(indicator == "TX_NET_NEW") %>%
  group_by(ageasentered, Year_Quarter) %>%
  summarise(
    Value = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  mutate(Is_Negative = Value < 0) # Create flag for if TX_NET_NEW is negative

# Count the number of quarters with negative values for each age group
declining_counts <- net_new_declining %>%
  group_by(ageasentered) %>%
  summarise(
    Declining_Quarter_Count = sum(Is_Negative),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  filter(Declining_Quarter_Count >= 2) # Filter where there are any two quarters with negative TX_NET_NEW
```

These age bands have had at least 2 quarters in the data with declining `TX_NET_NEW`:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(declining_counts)
```

We can also check for consecutive declines.
```{r}
# Identify consecutive declines in net new patient counts by age group
consecutive_declines <- net_new_declining %>%
  arrange(ageasentered, Year_Quarter) %>%
  group_by(ageasentered) %>%
  mutate(
    # Check if the current and previous quarters are negative
    Consecutive_Decline = ifelse(Is_Negative, lag(Is_Negative, default = FALSE), FALSE) & Is_Negative,
    # Create a group for each series of consecutive declines
    Decline_Group = cumsum(!Consecutive_Decline)
  ) %>%
  filter(Is_Negative) %>%
  group_by(ageasentered, Decline_Group) %>% # Group by age and decline group
  summarise(
    Consecutive_Decline_Count = n(),
    Year_Quarter_List = paste(Year_Quarter, collapse = ", "), # List of quarters
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  filter(Consecutive_Decline_Count >= 2) %>% # Keep at least 2 declines
  select(ageasentered, Consecutive_Decline_Count, Year_Quarter_List)
```

Every time an age group has two or more quarters in decline in a row:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(consecutive_declines)
```

**Age Bands with Two of More Total Declining Quarters**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(unique(declining_counts$ageasentered))
```

**Age Bands with Two or More Consecutive Declines**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(unique(consecutive_declines$ageasentered))
```

## 6. Which sub-national units (SNUs) had net new on treatment volumes below those newly on treatment for the year?

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Compare net new patients to newly initiated patients for fiscal year 2061
net_new_vs_new <- data %>%
  filter(indicator %in% c("TX_NET_NEW", "TX_NEW"), fiscal_year == 2061) %>%
  group_by(snu1, indicator) %>%
  summarise(Total_Cumulative = sum(cumulative, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = indicator, values_from = Total_Cumulative, values_fill = 0)

# Identify SNUs where net new patients are less than newly initiated patients
net_new_less_than_new <- net_new_vs_new %>%
  filter(TX_NET_NEW < TX_NEW) # Filter to only when NET_NEW is less than NEW
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(net_new_vs_new)
```

``r net_new_less_than_new$snu1`` had net new on treatment volumes below those newly on treatment for the year `FY2061`.

If we want to look at SNUs by quarter instead of the entire year, we can do that as well.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Compare net new patients to newly initiated patients for fiscal year 2061 by quarter
net_new_vs_new_qtr <- data_long %>%
  filter(indicator %in% c("TX_NET_NEW", "TX_NEW"), fiscal_year == 2061) %>%
  group_by(snu1, indicator, quarter) %>%
  summarise(Total_Cumulative = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = indicator, values_from = Total_Cumulative, values_fill = 0)

# Identify quarters where SNUs had net new patients are less than newly initiated patients
net_new_less_than_new_qtr <- net_new_vs_new_qtr %>%
  filter(TX_NET_NEW < TX_NEW) # Filter to only when NET_NEW is less than NEW
net_new_less_than_new
```
## 7. Are any sub-national units (SNUs) lagging behind with getting a majority of patients onto 6 months or more of multi-month dispensing ( MMD) of treatment?

```{r}
# Filter data for TX_CURR indicator in Q3 of 2061 and relevant ARV dispensing categories
q7 <- data_long %>%
  filter(
    indicator == "TX_CURR",
    fiscal_year == 2061,
    quarter == 3,
    otherdisaggregate %in% c(
      "ARV Dispensing Quantity - 3 to 5 months",
      "ARV Dispensing Quantity - 6 or more months",
      "ARV Dispensing Quantity - Less than 3 months"
    )
  ) %>%
  # Group by SNU and ARV dispensing category, and calculate total dispensing quantity
  group_by(snu1, otherdisaggregate) %>%
  summarise(Total = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
  # Reshape data to have separate columns for each ARV dispensing category
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = otherdisaggregate,
    values_from = Total,
    values_fill = 0
  ) %>%
  # Calculate total ARV dispensing for less than 6 months and overall
  mutate(
    Less_than_6_months = `ARV Dispensing Quantity - 3 to 5 months` +
      `ARV Dispensing Quantity - Less than 3 months`,
    Total_ARV = Less_than_6_months + `ARV Dispensing Quantity - 6 or more months`
  ) %>%
  # Calculate percentage of ARV dispensing for 6 or more months
  mutate(Percentage_6_or_more_months = round(
    (`ARV Dispensing Quantity - 6 or more months` / Total_ARV) * 100,
    2
  )) %>%
  mutate(Percentage_6_or_more_months = paste0(Percentage_6_or_more_months, "%")) %>%
  select(snu1, Less_than_6_months, `ARV Dispensing Quantity - 6 or more months`, Percentage_6_or_more_months)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(q7)
```
It appears that `Midwest` and `Northwest` are lagging below 50% 6 month or more MMD in `FY2061 Q3`, our most recent quarter.

```{r}
# Function to analyze ARV dispensing data for a given quarter
analyze_arv_dispensing <- function(data, quarter) {
  data %>%
    filter(
      indicator == "TX_CURR",
      fiscal_year == 2061,
      quarter == quarter,
      otherdisaggregate %in% c(
        "ARV Dispensing Quantity - 3 to 5 months",
        "ARV Dispensing Quantity - 6 or more months",
        "ARV Dispensing Quantity - Less than 3 months"
      )
    ) %>%
    group_by(snu1, otherdisaggregate) %>%
    summarise(Total = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
    pivot_wider(
      names_from = otherdisaggregate,
      values_from = Total,
      values_fill = 0
    ) %>%
    mutate(
      Less_than_6_months = `ARV Dispensing Quantity - 3 to 5 months` +
        `ARV Dispensing Quantity - Less than 3 months`,
      Total_ARV = Less_than_6_months + `ARV Dispensing Quantity - 6 or more months`
    ) %>%
    mutate(Percentage_6_or_more_months = round(
      (`ARV Dispensing Quantity - 6 or more months` / Total_ARV) * 100,
      2
    )) %>%
    mutate(Percentage_6_or_more_months = paste0(Percentage_6_or_more_months, "%")) %>%
    select(snu1, Less_than_6_months, `ARV Dispensing Quantity - 6 or more months`, Percentage_6_or_more_months)
}

# Grab results for the previous two quarters too
q7_q2 <- analyze_arv_dispensing(data_long, quarter = 2)
q7_q1 <- analyze_arv_dispensing(data_long, quarter = 1)
```

This was the case in the previous two quarters as well.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(q7_q2)
print(q7_q1)
```

## 8. Do we see any differences in viral load coverage (VLC) by age and sex for the current year?

*Using `FY2061 Q3` data.*

The equation for Viral Load Coverage is as follows:

$\(Viral Load Coverage [Current Quarter] = (\frac{\text{TX_PVLS}[\text{Two Quarters Ago}]}{\text{TX_CURR}[\text{Current Quarter}]})\)$

```{r}
# Calculate TX_CURR_Lag
tx_curr_lag <- data_long %>%
  filter(
    indicator == "TX_CURR_Lag2",
    fiscal_year == 2061,
    quarter == 3,
    use_for_age == "Y"
  ) %>%
  group_by(sex, ageasentered) %>%
  summarise(TX_CURR_Lag = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Calculate TX_PVLS
tx_pvls <- data_long %>%
  filter(
    indicator == "TX_PVLS",
    fiscal_year == 2061,
    quarter == 3,
    numeratordenom == "D"
  ) %>%
  group_by(sex, ageasentered) %>%
  summarise(TX_PVLS = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Combine TX_CURR_Lag and TX_PVLS data, calculating VLC
vlc_data <- tx_curr_lag %>%
  left_join(tx_pvls, by = c("sex", "ageasentered")) %>%
  mutate(VLC = TX_PVLS / TX_CURR_Lag) %>%
  filter(!is.na(VLC)) # Remove rows with NA values in VLC

# Calculate VLC percentage and prepare results
results_q8 <- vlc_data %>%
  mutate(VLC_Percentage = VLC * 100) %>%
  select(sex, ageasentered, VLC_Percentage)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(results_q8 %>%
  mutate(VLC_Percentage = paste0(round(VLC_Percentage, 2), "%")))
```

```{r}
# Calculate Viral Load Coverage (VLC) differences between men and women
vlc_diff <- vlc_data %>%
  filter(ageasentered != "Unknown Age") %>%
  group_by(ageasentered) %>%
  summarise(
    VLC_Women = sum(TX_PVLS[sex == "Female"], na.rm = TRUE) / sum(TX_CURR_Lag[sex == "Female"], na.rm = TRUE) * 100,
    VLC_Men = sum(TX_PVLS[sex == "Male"], na.rm = TRUE) / sum(TX_CURR_Lag[sex == "Male"], na.rm = TRUE) * 100,
    # Calculate absolute difference in VLC
    Difference = abs(VLC_Women - VLC_Men),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  # Filter out rows with NA values in VLC calculations
  filter(!is.na(VLC_Women) & !is.na(VLC_Men))

# Identify the age group with the most pronounced difference in VLC
most_pronounced_diff <- vlc_diff %>%
  filter(Difference == max(Difference)) %>%
  mutate(
    VLC_Percentage = paste0(round(Difference, 2), "%"),
    VLC_Men = paste0(round(VLC_Men, 2), "%"),
    VLC_Women = paste0(round(VLC_Women, 2), "%")
  ) %>%
  select(ageasentered, VLC_Men, VLC_Women, VLC_Percentage)
```

```{r}
# Create a plot of VLC by age and sex
vlc_data <- vlc_data %>%
  filter(ageasentered != "Unknown Age")

ggplot(vlc_data, aes(x = ageasentered, y = VLC, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  labs(
    title = "Viral Load Coverage (VLC) by Age and Sex",
    x = "Age",
    y = "VLC (%)",
    color = "Sex"
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Female" = moody_blue, "Male" = genoa)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 100), limits = c(0, 1.2), breaks = seq(0, 1.2, by = .2)) +
  si_style()
```

With the exception of the `15-19` age group, women demonstrate higher viral load coverage (VLC) than men. The highest VLC is found in the youngest (`<01`) and oldest age groups (`55-59`, `60-64`, `65+`). There is an upward trend in VLC for children aged `01-04`, `05-09`, and `10-14`, followed by a decline in the `15-19` and `20-24` age groups, after which women's VLC gradually rises again. In contrast, men experience a decline through the `30-34` age group before starting to increase. The age group with the most significant difference in VLC between men and women is ``r most_pronounced_diff$ageasentered``, which has a ``r most_pronounced_diff$VLC_Percentage`` difference. This pattern is more pronounced among men, who show a sharper decline in their teens and twenties, as well as a steeper rise in their thirties and forties. Notably, the `50-54` age group stands out as an outlier, exhibiting much lower VLC than the overall trend would suggest.

#### **<span style="color:#2057a7">Question: what if the PLHIV age out of one group and into another? For instance, if someone is 19 in 2061 Q1 and 20 in 2061 Q3? Also, the question asks for the full year. Should I calculate each quarter separately, or would lumping them together (i.e. not filtering on quarter) provide better results?</span>**
